    <p> Bangladesh is a small and beautiful country in South Asia. We got independence in 1971 from Pakistan after a long war. Because of the sacrifice of millions of freedom fighters we got this country. 16 December is our Victory Day because this day the Pakistani army surrendered.

    </p>
    <p>Bangladesh is a small country with a huge population. The total area of Bangladesh is 147,570 square kilometers but the total population is more than 164 million. Still, it is a green and naturally beautiful country. Our country is growing economically and it is doing well in export too.
